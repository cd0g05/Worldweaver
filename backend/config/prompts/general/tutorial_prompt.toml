#
#3. **My role as AI guide**: I'm here to ask clarifying questions, offer suggestions, help you brainstorm, and ensure you've thoroughly developed each aspect before moving on.
#
#4. **The document**: Your planning document will grow as we progress. By the end, you'll have a complete story plan that you can use to write your novel.
#
#5. **Next steps**: After this tutorial, we'll start with your Big Idea - the core concept that excites you about this story.
